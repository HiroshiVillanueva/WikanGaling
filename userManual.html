                    <p style="color: black;">
                        WIKANGALING began as a school project created by the three of us — classmates who loved language and interactive design.
                        We noticed younger students zoning out during language drills but lighting up for games. Our goal was simple: make language
                        learning feel like play. This manual will walk you through every feature we built so teachers, parents, and students can get
                        the most out of WIKANGALING.
